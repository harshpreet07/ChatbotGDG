Title: E. Not a Nim Problem

Time Limit: time limit per test2 seconds
Memory Limit: memory limit per test512 megabytes

Statement:
Two players, Alice and Bob, are playing a game. They have n piles of stones, with the i-th pile initially containing a_i stones.

On their turn, a player can choose any pile of stones and take any positive number of stones from it, with one condition:

- let the current number of stones in the pile be x. It is not allowed to take from the pile a number of stones y such that the greatest common divisor of x and y is not equal to 1.
The player who cannot make a move loses. Both players play optimally (that is, if a player has a strategy that allows them to win, no matter how the opponent responds, they will win). Alice goes first.

Determine who will win.

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

- the first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3 · 10^5);
- the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^7).
Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 3 · 10^5.

For each test case, output Alice if Alice wins, or Bob if Bob wins.
