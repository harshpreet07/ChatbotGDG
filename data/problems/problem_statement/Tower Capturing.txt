Title: Tower Capturing

Time Limit: time limit per test2 seconds
Memory Limit: memory limit per test256 megabytes

Problem Statement:
There are $$$n$$$ towers at $$$n$$$ distinct points $$$(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)$$$, such that no three are collinear and no four are concyclic. Initially, you own towers $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ and $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$, and you want to capture all of them. To do this, you can do the following operation any number of times:

- Pick two towers $$$P$$$ and $$$Q$$$ you own and one tower $$$R$$$ you don't own, such that the circle through $$$P$$$, $$$Q$$$, and $$$R$$$ contains all $$$n$$$ towers inside of it.
- Afterwards, capture all towers in or on triangle $$$\triangle PQR$$$, including $$$R$$$ itself.
Count the number of attack plans of minimal length . Note that it might not be possible to capture all towers, in which case the answer is $$$0$$$.

Since the answer may be large, output it modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 250$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$4 \leq n \leq 100$$$) — the number of towers.

The $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains two integers $$$x_i$$$ and $$$y_i$$$ ($$$-10^4 \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^4$$$) — the location of the $$$i$$$-th tower. Initially, you own towers $$$(x_1, y_1)$$$ and $$$(x_2, y_2)$$$.

All towers are at distinct locations, no three towers are collinear, and no four towers are concyclic.

The sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$1000$$$.

For each test case, output a single integer — the number of attack plans of minimal length after which you capture all towers, modulo $$$998\,244\,353$$$.

In the first test case, there is only one possible attack plan of shortest length, shown below.

- Use the operation with $$$P =$$$ tower $$$1$$$, $$$Q =$$$ tower $$$2$$$, and $$$R =$$$ tower $$$5$$$. The circle through these three towers contains all towers inside of it, and as a result towers $$$3$$$ and $$$5$$$ are captured.
- Use the operation with $$$P =$$$ tower $$$5$$$, $$$Q =$$$ tower $$$1$$$, and $$$R =$$$ tower $$$4$$$. The circle through these three towers contains all towers inside of it, and as a result tower $$$4$$$ is captured.
In the second case, for example, you can never capture the tower at $$$(3, 10\,000)$$$.
