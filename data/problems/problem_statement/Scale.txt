Problem Statement:
Tina has a square grid with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$n$$$ columns. Each cell in the grid is either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$.

Tina wants to reduce the grid by a factor of $$$k$$$ ( ). To do this, Tina splits the grid into $$$k \times k$$$ nonoverlapping blocks of cells such that every cell belongs to exactly one block.

Tina then replaces each block of cells with a single cell equal to the value of the cells in the block. It is guaranteed that every cell in the same block has the same value .

For example, the following demonstration shows a grid being reduced by factor of $$$3$$$.

Help Tina reduce the grid by a factor of $$$k$$$.

The first line contains $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 100$$$) – the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \leq n \leq 1000$$$, $$$1 \le k \le n$$$, ) — the number of rows and columns of the grid, and the factor that Tina wants to reduce the grid by.

Each of the following $$$n$$$ lines contain $$$n$$$ characters describing the cells of the grid. Each character is either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$. It is guaranteed every $$$k$$$ by $$$k$$$ block has the same value.

It is guaranteed the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$1000$$$.

For each test case, output the grid reduced by a factor of $$$k$$$ on a new line.
