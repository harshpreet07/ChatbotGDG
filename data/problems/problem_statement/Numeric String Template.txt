Title: Numeric String Template

Time Limit: time limit per test2 seconds
Memory Limit: memory limit per test256 megabytes

Problem Statement:
Kristina has an array $$$a$$$, called a template , consisting of $$$n$$$ integers. She also has $$$m$$$ strings, each consisting only of lowercase Latin letters. The strings are numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$. She wants to check which strings match the template.

A string $$$s$$$ is considered to match the template if all of the following conditions are simultaneously satisfied:

- The length of the string $$$s$$$ is equal to the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.
- The same numbers from $$$a$$$ correspond to the same symbols from $$$s$$$. So, if $$$a_i = a_j$$$, then $$$s_i = s_j$$$ for ($$$1 \le i, j \le n$$$).
- The same symbols from $$$s$$$ correspond to the same numbers from $$$a$$$. So, if $$$s_i = s_j$$$, then $$$a_i = a_j$$$ for ($$$1 \le i, j \le n$$$).
For example, if $$$a$$$ = [$$$3, 5, 2, 1, 3$$$], then the string " abfda " matches the template, while the string " afbfa " does not, since the character " f " corresponds to both numbers $$$1$$$ and $$$5$$$.

The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The following descriptions are for the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of elements in the array $$$a$$$.

The second line of each test case contains exactly $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_i$$$ ($$$-10^9 \le a_i \le 10^9$$$) — the elements of the array $$$a$$$.

The third line of each test case contains a single integer $$$m$$$ ($$$1 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of strings to check for template matching.

Following are $$$m$$$ strings, each containing a non-empty string $$$s_j$$$ ($$$1 \le |s_j| \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$), consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$, and that the sum of the lengths of all strings does not exceed $$$2 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output $$$m$$$ lines. On the $$$i$$$-th line ($$$1 \le i \le m$$$) output:

- " YES ", if the string with index $$$i$$$ matches the template;
- " NO " otherwise.
You may output the answer in any case (for example, the strings " yEs ", " yes ", " Yes ", and " YES " will be recognized as a positive answer).

The first test case is explained in the problem statement.
