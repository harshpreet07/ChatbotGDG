Problem Statement:
Jane has decided to solve a list of $$$n$$$ problems on Codeforces. The $$$i$$$-th problem in her list has difficulty $$$d_i$$$, and the last problem in the list is the hardest one (for every problem $$$j < n$$$, $$$d_j < d_n$$$).

Jane's problem-solving skill is some integer $$$x$$$ (unknown to you). If a problem's difficulty is greater than $$$x$$$, then Jane cannot solve it, otherwise she can solve it.

Jane has solved all problems form the list, except for the last one — she found out that it was too difficult for her. Can you uniquely determine the value of $$$x$$$ — Jane's problem solving skill?

The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 1000$$$) — the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of two lines:

- the first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 50$$$) — the number of problems;
- the second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n$$$ ($$$1 \le d_i \le 50$$$).
Additional constraint on the input: in every test case, the last problem is more difficult than every other problem (i. e. $$$d_n > d_j$$$ for every $$$j < n$$$). This means that at least one possible value of $$$x$$$ exists.

For each test case, print one line:

- if you can determine the value of $$$x$$$ uniquely, print $$$x$$$;
- otherwise, print Ambiguous . The checking program is case-sensitive, so if you print  ambiguous  or  AMBIGUOUS , your answer will be considered wrong .
In the second test case of the example, the value of $$$x$$$ could be $$$11$$$, but it also could be $$$10$$$ (other possible values for $$$x$$$ also exist).
