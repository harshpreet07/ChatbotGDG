Title: Level Up

Time Limit: time limit per test4 seconds
Memory Limit: memory limit per test512 megabytes

Problem Statement:
Monocarp is playing a computer game. He starts the game being level $$$1$$$. He is about to fight $$$n$$$ monsters, in order from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. The level of the $$$i$$$-th monster is $$$a_i$$$.

For each monster in the given order, Monocarp's encounter goes as follows:

- if Monocarp's level is strictly higher than the monster's level, the monster flees (runs away);
- otherwise, Monocarp fights the monster.
After every $$$k$$$-th fight with a monster ( fleeing monsters do not count ), Monocarp's level increases by $$$1$$$. So, his level becomes $$$2$$$ after $$$k$$$ monsters he fights, $$$3$$$ after $$$2k$$$ monsters, $$$4$$$ after $$$3k$$$ monsters, and so on.

You need to process $$$q$$$ queries of the following form:

- $$$i~x$$$: will Monocarp fight the $$$i$$$-th monster (or will this monster flee) if the parameter $$$k$$$ is equal to $$$x$$$?
The first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \le n, q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the number of monsters and the number of queries.

The second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the levels of the monsters.

In the $$$j$$$-th of the following $$$q$$$ lines, two integers $$$i$$$ and $$$x$$$ ($$$1 \le i, x \le n$$$) — the index of the monster and the number of fights required for a level up in the $$$j$$$-th query.

For each query, output " YES ", if Monocarp will fight the $$$i$$$-th monster in this query, and " NO ", if the $$$i$$$-th monster flees.
