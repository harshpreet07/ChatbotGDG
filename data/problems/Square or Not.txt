Statement:
A beautiful binary matrix is a matrix that has ones on its edges and zeros inside.

Today, Sakurako was playing with a beautiful binary matrix of size r x c and created a binary string s by writing down all the rows of the matrix, starting from the first and ending with the r-th. More formally, the element from the matrix in the i-th row and j-th column corresponds to the ((i-1)*c+j)-th element of the string.

You need to check whether the beautiful matrix from which the string s was obtained could be squared . In other words, you need to check whether the string s could have been build from a square beautiful binary matrix (i.e., one where r=c).

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5) — the length of the string.

The second line of each test case contains the string s of length n. The string is always the result of writing out the strings of a beautiful matrix.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Print " Yes ", if the original matrix could have been square, and " No " otherwise.

For the second test case, string 1111 can be obtained from the matrix:

For the third test case, string 111101111 can be obtained from the matrix:

There is no square matrix in the fourth case, such that the string can be obtained from it.
