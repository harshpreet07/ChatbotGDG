Title: Upload More RAM

Time Limit: time limit per test1 second
Memory Limit: memory limit per test256 megabytes

Problem Statement:
Oh no, the ForceCodes servers are running out of memory! Luckily, you can help them out by uploading some of your RAM!

You want to upload $$$n$$$ GBs of RAM. Every second, you will upload either $$$0$$$ or $$$1$$$ GB of RAM. However, there is a restriction on your network speed: in any $$$k$$$ consecutive seconds, you can upload only at most $$$1$$$ GB of RAM in total.

Find the minimum number of seconds needed to upload $$$n$$$ GBs of RAM!

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$1 \le n, k \le 100$$$) — the number of GBs that you want to upload and the length of the time window respectively.

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of seconds needed to upload $$$n$$$ GBs of RAM.

In the first test case, you can upload $$$1$$$ GB of RAM per second, so to upload $$$5$$$ GBs, you need $$$5$$$ seconds.

In the second test case, you can upload $$$1$$$ GB in the first second, $$$0$$$ GBs in the second second, and $$$1$$$ GB in the third second, which in total adds up to exactly $$$2$$$ GBs of uploaded RAM.

In the third test case, you can upload $$$1$$$ GB in the first second, $$$0$$$ GBs in the second second, $$$0$$$ GBs in the third second, and $$$1$$$ GB in the fourth second, which in total adds up to exactly $$$2$$$ GBs of uploaded RAM.
