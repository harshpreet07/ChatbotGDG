Title: A. Turtle and Good Strings

Time Limit: time limit per test1 second
Memory Limit: memory limit per test256 megabytes

Statement:
Turtle thinks a string s is a good string if there exists a sequence of strings t_1, t_2, ..., t_k (k is an arbitrary integer) such that:

- k ≥ 2.
- s = t_1 + t_2 + ... + t_k, where + represents the concatenation operation. For example, \texttt{abc} = \texttt{a} + \texttt{bc}.
- For all 1 ≤ i < j ≤ k, the first character of t_i isn't equal to the last character of t_j.
Turtle is given a string s consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Please tell him whether the string s is a good string!

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ≤ t ≤ 500). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the length of the string.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of length n, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

For each test case, output " YES " if the string s is a good string, and " NO " otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings " yEs ", " yes ", " Yes ", and " YES " will be recognized as positive responses.

In the first test case, the sequence of strings \texttt{a}, \texttt{a} satisfies the condition s = t_1 + t_2 + ... + t_k, but the first character of t_1 is equal to the last character of t_2. It can be seen that there doesn't exist any sequence of strings which satisfies all of the conditions, so the answer is " NO ".

In the third test case, the sequence of strings \texttt{ab}, \texttt{cb} satisfies all of the conditions.

In the fourth test case, the sequence of strings \texttt{abca}, \texttt{bcab}, \texttt{cabc} satisfies all of the conditions.
