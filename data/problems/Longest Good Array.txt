Title: C. Longest Good Array

Time Limit: time limit per test2 seconds
Memory Limit: memory limit per test256 megabytes

Statement:
Today, Sakurako was studying arrays. An array a of length n is considered good if and only if:

- the array a is increasing, meaning a_{i - 1} < a_i for all 2 ≤ i ≤ n;
- the differences between adjacent elements are increasing, meaning a_i - a_{i-1} < a_{i+1} - a_i for all 2 ≤ i < n.
Sakurako has come up with boundaries l and r and wants to construct a good array of maximum length, where l ≤ a_i ≤ r for all a_i.

Help Sakurako find the maximum length of a good array for the given l and r.

The first line contains a single integer t (1≤ t≤ 10^4)  — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers l and r (1≤ l≤ r≤ 10^9).

For each test case, output a single integer  — the length of the longest good array Sakurako can form given l and r.

For l=1 and r=5, one possible array could be (1,2,5). It can be proven that an array of length 4 does not exist for the given l and r.

For l=2 and r=2, the only possible array is (2).

For l=10 and r=20, the only possible array is (10,11,13,16,20).
