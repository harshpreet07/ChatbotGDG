Title: Triple Operations

Time Limit: time limit per test1 second
Memory Limit: memory limit per test256 megabytes

Problem Statement:
On the board Ivy wrote down all integers from $$$l$$$ to $$$r$$$, inclusive.

In an operation, she does the following:

- pick two numbers $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ on the board, erase them, and in their place write the numbers $$$3x$$$ and $$$\lfloor \frac{y}{3} \rfloor$$$. (Here $$$\lfloor \bullet \rfloor$$$ denotes rounding down to the nearest integer).
What is the minimum number of operations Ivy needs to make all numbers on the board equal $$$0$$$? We have a proof that this is always possible.

The first line contains an integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains two integers $$$l$$$ and $$$r$$$ ($$$1 \leq l < r \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$$$).

For each test case, output a single integer — the minimum number of operations needed to make all numbers on the board equal $$$0$$$.

In the first test case, we can perform $$$5$$$ operations as follows: $$$$$$ 1,2,3 \xrightarrow[x=1,\,y=2]{} 3,0,3 \xrightarrow[x=0,\,y=3]{} 1,0,3 \xrightarrow[x=0,\,y=3]{} 1,0,1 \xrightarrow[x=0,\,y=1]{} 0,0,1 \xrightarrow[x=0,\,y=1]{} 0,0,0 .$$$$$$
