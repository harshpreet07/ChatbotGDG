Statement:
Piggy gives Turtle three sequences a_1, a_2, ..., a_n, b_1, b_2, ..., b_n, and c_1, c_2, ..., c_n.

Turtle will choose a subsequence of 1, 2, ..., n of length m, let it be p_1, p_2, ..., p_m. The subsequence should satisfy the following conditions:

- a_{p_1} ≤ a_{p_2} ≤ ·s ≤ a_{p_m};
- All b_{p_i} for all indices i are pairwise distinct , i.e., there don't exist two different indices i, j such that b_{p_i} = b_{p_j}.
Help him find the maximum value of ∑\limits_{i = 1}^m c_{p_i}, or tell him that it is impossible to choose a subsequence of length m that satisfies the conditions above.

Recall that a sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

The first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n ≤ 3000, 1 ≤ m ≤ 5) — the lengths of the three sequences and the required length of the subsequence.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ n) — the elements of the sequence a.

The third line contains n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ n) — the elements of the sequence b.

The fourth line contains n integers c_1, c_2, ..., c_n (1 ≤ c_i ≤ 10^4) — the elements of the sequence c.

Output a single integer — the maximum value of ∑\limits_{i = 1}^m c_{p_i}. If it is impossible to choose a subsequence of length m that satisfies the conditions above, output -1.

In the first example, we can choose p = [1, 2], then c_{p_1} + c_{p_2} = 1 + 4 = 5. We can't choose p = [2, 4] since a_2 > a_4, violating the first condition. We can't choose p = [2, 3] either since b_2 = b_3, violating the second condition. We can choose p = [1, 4], but c_1 + c_4 = 4, which isn't maximum.

In the second example, we can choose p = [4, 6, 7].

In the third example, it is impossible to choose a subsequence of length 3 that satisfies both of the conditions.
