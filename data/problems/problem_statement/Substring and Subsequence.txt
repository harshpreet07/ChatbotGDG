Title: Substring and Subsequence

Time Limit: time limit per test2 seconds
Memory Limit: memory limit per test256 megabytes

Problem Statement:
You are given two strings $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, both consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

A subsequence of a string is a string which can be obtained by removing several (possibly zero) characters from the original string. A substring of a string is a contiguous subsequence of that string.

For example, consider the string abac :

-  a , b , c , ab , aa , ac , ba , bc , aba , abc , aac , bac and abac are its subsequences;
-  a , b , c , ab , ba , ac , aba , bac and abac are its substrings.
Your task is to calculate the minimum possible length of the string that contains $$$a$$$ as a substring and $$$b$$$ as a subsequence.

The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^3$$$) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a string $$$a$$$ ($$$1 \le |a| \le 100$$$), consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

The second line of each test case contains a string $$$b$$$ ($$$1 \le |b| \le 100$$$), consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum possible length of the string that contains $$$a$$$ as a substring and $$$b$$$ as a subsequence.

In the examples below, the characters that correspond to the subsequence equal to $$$b$$$ are bolded.

In the first example, one of the possible answers is .

In the second example, one of the possible answers is .

In the third example, one of the possible answers is mmm .

In the fourth example, one of the possible answers is .

In the fifth example, one of the possible answers is .
