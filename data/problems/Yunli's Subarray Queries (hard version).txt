Title: G2. Yunli's Subarray Queries (hard version)

Time Limit: time limit per test3 seconds
Memory Limit: memory limit per test512 megabytes

Statement:
This is the hard version of the problem. In this version, it is guaranteed that r ≥q l+k-1 for all queries.

For an arbitrary array b, Yunli can perform the following operation any number of times:

- Select an index i. Set b_i = x where x is any integer she desires (x is not limited to the interval [1,n]).
Denote f(b) as the minimum number of operations she needs to perform until there exists a consecutive subarray^{\text{∗}} of length at least k in b.

Yunli is given an array a of size n and asks you q queries. In each query, you must output ∑_{j=l+k-1}^{r} f([a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_j]).

^{\text{∗}}If there exists a consecutive subarray of length k that starts at index i (1 ≤q i ≤q |b|-k+1), then b_j = b_{j-1} + 1 for all i < j ≤q i+k-1.

The first line contains t (1 ≤q t ≤q 10^4) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, k, and q (1 ≤q k ≤q n ≤q 2 · 10^5, 1 ≤q q ≤q 2 · 10^5) — the length of the array, the length of the consecutive subarray, and the number of queries.

The following line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤q a_i ≤q n).

The following q lines contain two integers l and r (1 ≤q l ≤q r ≤q n, r ≥q l+k-1) — the bounds of the query.

It is guaranteed the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5 and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 2 · 10^5.

Output ∑_{j=l+k-1}^{r} f([a_l, a_{l+1}, ..., a_j]) for each query on a new line.

In the second query of the first testcase, we calculate the following function values:

- f([2,3,2,1,2])=3 because Yunli can set b_3=4, b_4=5, and b_5=6, making a consecutive subarray of size 5 in 3 moves.
- f([2,3,2,1,2,3])=2 because we can set b_3=0 and b_2=-1, making a consecutive subarray of size 5 in 2 moves (starting at position 2)
The answer to this query is 3+2=5.
