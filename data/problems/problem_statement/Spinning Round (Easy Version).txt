Problem Statement:


You are given a permutation $$$p$$$ of length $$$n$$$. You are also given a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$, consisting only of the character ? .

For each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$:

- Define $$$l_i$$$ as the largest index $$$j < i$$$ such that $$$p_j > p_i$$$. If there is no such index, $$$l_i := i$$$.
- Define $$$r_i$$$ as the smallest index $$$j > i$$$ such that $$$p_j > p_i$$$. If there is no such index, $$$r_i := i$$$.
Initially, you have an undirected graph with $$$n$$$ vertices (numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$) and no edges. Then, for each $$$i$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, add one edge to the graph:

- If $$$s_i =$$$ L , add the edge $$$(i, l_i)$$$ to the graph.
- If $$$s_i =$$$ R , add the edge $$$(i, r_i)$$$ to the graph.
- If $$$s_i =$$$ ? , either add the edge $$$(i, l_i)$$$ or the edge $$$(i, r_i)$$$ to the graph at your choice.
Find the maximum possible diameter$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ over all connected graphs that you can form. Output $$$-1$$$ if it is not possible to form any connected graphs.

$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ Let $$$d(s, t)$$$ denote the smallest number of edges on any path between $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$.

The diameter of the graph is defined as the maximum value of $$$d(s, t)$$$ over all pairs of vertices $$$s$$$ and $$$t$$$.

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 4 \cdot 10^5$$$) — the length of the permutation $$$p$$$.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1,p_2,\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \le p_i \le n$$$) — the elements of $$$p$$$, which are guaranteed to form a permutation.

The third line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$. It is guaranteed that it consists only of the character ? .

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$4 \cdot 10^5$$$.

For each test case, output the maximum possible diameter over all connected graphs that you form, or $$$-1$$$ if it is not possible to form any connected graphs.

In the first test case, here are some possible connected graphs that you can form (the labels are indices):

In the second test case, the only connected graph has a diameter of $$$1$$$.
