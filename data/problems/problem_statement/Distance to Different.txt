Title: Distance to Different

Time Limit: time limit per test2 seconds
Memory Limit: memory limit per test512 megabytes

Problem Statement:
Consider an array $$$a$$$ of $$$n$$$ integers, where every element is from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$, and every integer from $$$1$$$ to $$$k$$$ appears at least once .

Let the array $$$b$$$ be constructed as follows: for the $$$i$$$-th element of $$$a$$$, $$$b_i$$$ is the distance to the closest element in $$$a$$$ which is not equal to $$$a_i$$$. In other words, $$$b_i = \min \limits_{j \in [1, n], a_j \ne a_i} |i - j|$$$.

For example, if $$$a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1]$$$, then $$$b = [2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1]$$$.

Calculate the number of different arrays $$$b$$$ you can obtain if you consider all possible arrays $$$a$$$, and print it modulo $$$998244353$$$.

The only line of the input contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$k$$$ ($$$2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$$$; $$$2 \le k \le \min(n, 10)$$$).

Print one integer â€” the number of different arrays $$$b$$$ you can obtain, taken modulo $$$998244353$$$.
