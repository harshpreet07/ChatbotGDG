Title: E. Klee's SUPER DUPER LARGE Array!!!

Time Limit: time limit per test2 seconds
Memory Limit: memory limit per test256 megabytes

Statement:
Klee has an array a of length n containing integers [k, k+1, ..., k+n-1] in that order. Klee wants to choose an index i (1 ≤q i ≤q n) such that x = |a_1 + a_2 + \dots + a_i - a_{i+1} - \dots - a_n| is minimized. Note that for an arbitrary integer z, |z| represents the absolute value of z.

Output the minimum possible value of x.

The first line contains t (1 ≤q t ≤q 10^4) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers n and k (2 ≤q n, k ≤q 10^9) — the length of the array and the starting element of the array.

For each test case, output the minimum value of x on a new line.

In the first sample, a = [2, 3]. When i = 1 is chosen, x = |2-3| = 1. It can be shown this is the minimum possible value of x.

In the third sample, a = [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. When i = 3 is chosen, x = |3 + 4 + 5 - 6 - 7| = 1. It can be shown this is the minimum possible value of x.
