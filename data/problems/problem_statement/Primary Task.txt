Problem Statement:
Dmitry wrote down $$$t$$$ integers on the board, and that is good. He is sure that he lost an important integer $$$n$$$ among them, and that is bad.

The integer $$$n$$$ had the form $$$\text{10^x}$$$ ($$$x \ge 2$$$), where the symbol '$$$\text{^}$$$' denotes exponentiation.. Something went wrong, and Dmitry missed the symbol '$$$\text{^}$$$' when writing the important integer. For example, instead of the integer $$$10^5$$$, he would have written $$$105$$$, and instead of $$$10^{19}$$$, he would have written $$$1019$$$.

Dmitry wants to understand which of the integers on the board could have been the important integer and which could not.

The first line of the input contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \le t \le 10^4$$$) — the number of integers on the board.

The next $$$t$$$ lines each contain an integer $$$a$$$ ($$$1 \le a \le 10000$$$) — the next integer from the board.

For each integer on the board, output " YES " if it could have been the important integer and " NO " otherwise.

You may output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings " yEs ", " yes ", " Yes ", and " YES " will be accepted as a positive answer.
