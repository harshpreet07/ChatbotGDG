Title: A. Minimize!

Time Limit: time limit per test1 second
Memory Limit: memory limit per test256 megabytes

Statement:
You are given two integers a and b (a ≤q b). Over all possible integer values of c (a ≤q c ≤q b), find the minimum value of (c - a) + (b - c).

The first line contains t (1 ≤q t ≤q 55) — the number of test cases.

Each test case contains two integers a and b (1 ≤q a ≤q b ≤q 10).

For each test case, output the minimum possible value of (c - a) + (b - c) on a new line.

In the first test case, you can choose c = 1 and obtain an answer of (1 - 1) + (2 - 1) = 1. It can be shown this is the minimum value possible.

In the second test case, you can choose c = 6 and obtain an answer of (6 - 3) + (10 - 6) = 7. It can be shown this is the minimum value possible.
