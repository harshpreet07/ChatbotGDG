Title: Sakurako's Test

Time Limit: time limit per test1 second
Memory Limit: memory limit per test256 megabytes

Problem Statement:
Sakurako will soon take a test. The test can be described as an array of integers $$$n$$$ and a task on it:

Given an integer $$$x$$$, Sakurako can perform the following operation any number of times:

- Choose an integer $$$i$$$ ($$$1\le i\le n$$$) such that $$$a_i\ge x$$$;
- Change the value of $$$a_i$$$ to $$$a_i-x$$$.
Using this operation any number of times, she must find the minimum possible median$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ of the array $$$a$$$.

Sakurako knows the array but does not know the integer $$$x$$$. Someone let it slip that one of the $$$q$$$ values of $$$x$$$ will be in the next test, so Sakurako is asking you what the answer is for each such $$$x$$$.

$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$The median of an array of length $$$n$$$ is the element that stands in the middle of the sorted array (at the $$$\frac{n+2}{2}$$$-th position for even $$$n$$$, and at the $$$\frac{n+1}{2}$$$-th for odd)

The first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1\le t\le 10^4$$$)  — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$1\le n,q\le 10^5$$$)  — the number of elements in the array and the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$$$ ($$$1\le a_i\le n$$$)  — the elements of the array.

The following $$$q$$$ lines each contain one integer $$$x$$$ ($$$1\le x\le n$$$).

It is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ across all test cases does not exceed $$$10^5$$$. The same guarantee applies to the sum of $$$q$$$ across all test cases.

For each test case, output $$$q$$$ integers  — the answer for each query.
