Statement:
You are given two arrays a_1, a_2, ..., a_n and b_1, b_2, ..., b_n.

You must perform the following operation exactly once :

- choose any indices l and r such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n;
- swap a_i and b_i for all i such that l ≤q i ≤q r.
Find the maximum possible value of \text{gcd}(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) + \text{gcd}(b_1, b_2, ..., b_n) after performing the operation exactly once. Also find the number of distinct pairs (l, r) which achieve the maximum value.

In the first line of the input, you are given a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^5), the number of test cases. Then the description of each test case follows.

In the first line of each test case, you are given a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2 · 10^5), representing the number of integers in each array.

In the next line, you are given n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) — the elements of the array a.

In the last line, you are given n integers b_1, b_2, ..., b_n (1 ≤ b_i ≤ 10^9) — the elements of the array b.

The sum of values of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 · 10^5.

For each test case, output a line with two integers: the maximum value of \text{gcd}(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n) + \text{gcd}(b_1, b_2, ..., b_n) after performing the operation exactly once, and the number of ways.

In the first, third, and fourth test cases, there's no way to achieve a higher GCD than 1 in any of the arrays, so the answer is 1 + 1 = 2. Any pair (l, r) achieves the same result; for example, in the first test case there are 36 such pairs.

In the last test case, you must choose l = 1, r = 2 to maximize the answer. In this case, the GCD of the first array is 5, and the GCD of the second array is 1, so the answer is 5 + 1 = 6, and the number of ways is 1.
