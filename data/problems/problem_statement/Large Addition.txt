Title: Large Addition

Time Limit: time limit per test1 second
Memory Limit: memory limit per test256 megabytes

Problem Statement:
A digit is large if it is between $$$5$$$ and $$$9$$$, inclusive. A positive integer is large if all of its digits are large.

You are given an integer $$$x$$$. Can it be the sum of two large positive integers with the same number of digits ?

The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \leq t \leq 10^4$$$) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer $$$x$$$ ($$$10 \leq x \leq 10^{18}$$$).

For each test case, output $$$\texttt{YES}$$$ if $$$x$$$ satisfies the condition, and $$$\texttt{NO}$$$ otherwise.

You can output $$$\texttt{YES}$$$ and $$$\texttt{NO}$$$ in any case (for example, strings $$$\texttt{yES}$$$, $$$\texttt{yes}$$$, and $$$\texttt{Yes}$$$ will be recognized as a positive response).

In the first test case, we can have $$$658 + 679 = 1337$$$.

In the second test case, it can be shown that no numbers of equal length and only consisting of large digits can add to $$$200$$$.

In the third test case, we can have $$$696\,969 + 696\,969 = 1\,393\,938$$$.

In the fourth test case, we can have $$$777 + 657 = 1434$$$.
