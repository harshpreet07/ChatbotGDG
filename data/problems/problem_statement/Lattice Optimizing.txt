Problem Statement:
Consider a grid graph with $$$n$$$ rows and $$$n$$$ columns. Let the cell in row $$$x$$$ and column $$$y$$$ be $$$(x,y)$$$. There exists a directed edge from $$$(x,y)$$$ to $$$(x+1,y)$$$, with non-negative integer value $$$d_{x,y}$$$, for all $$$1\le x < n, 1\le y \le n$$$, and there also exists a directed edge from $$$(x,y)$$$ to $$$(x,y+1)$$$, with non-negative integer value $$$r_{x,y}$$$, for all $$$1\le x \le n, 1\le y < n$$$.

Initially, you are at $$$(1,1)$$$, with an empty set $$$S$$$. You need to walk along the edges and eventually reach $$$(n,n)$$$. Whenever you pass an edge, its value will be inserted into $$$S$$$. Please maximize the MEX$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$ of $$$S$$$ when you reach $$$(n,n)$$$.

$$$^{\text{∗}}$$$The MEX (minimum excluded) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to the array. For instance:

- The MEX of $$$[2,2,1]$$$ is $$$0$$$, because $$$0$$$ does not belong to the array.
- The MEX of $$$[3,1,0,1]$$$ is $$$2$$$, because $$$0$$$ and $$$1$$$ belong to the array, but $$$2$$$ does not.
- The MEX of $$$[0,3,1,2]$$$ is $$$4$$$, because $$$0, 1, 2$$$, and $$$3$$$ belong to the array, but $$$4$$$ does not.
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1\le t\le100$$$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2\le n\le20$$$) — the number of rows and columns.

Each of the next $$$n-1$$$ lines contains $$$n$$$ integers separated by single spaces — the matrix $$$d$$$ ($$$0\le d_{x,y}\le 2n-2$$$).

Each of the next $$$n$$$ lines contains $$$n-1$$$ integers separated by single spaces — the matrix $$$r$$$ ($$$0\le r_{x,y}\le 2n-2$$$).

It is guaranteed that the sum of all $$$n^3$$$ does not exceed $$$8000$$$.

For each test case, print a single integer — the maximum MEX of $$$S$$$ when you reach $$$(n,n)$$$.

In the first test case, the grid graph and one of the optimal paths are as follows:

In the second test case, the grid graph and one of the optimal paths are as follows:
